Project: JumpingJim.java
Author: Howard Cheung

Instructions: Ensure all 5 classes are in the same directory before you compile. The 5 are:
-JumpingJim.java
-GraphSet.java
-Node.java
-Edge.java
-Dijkstra.java

Java 7 should be the minimum to compile and run, but Java 8 and above is recommended.
Because all files are in the same directory, the only command needed to compile is:

javac JumpingJim.java

Subsequently, the only command needed to run is:

java JumpingJim

A copy of the pseudocode for questions 1 and 2 in the form of a text file will be included in this zip.
